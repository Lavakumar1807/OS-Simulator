            <strong>Page Buffering ALgorithm</strong>
           
                <br>
                <p class="mx-10">The Page Buffering Algorithm (PBA) is an enhancement of 
                        traditional page replacement algorithms used in virtual memory management.
                        Its goal is to improve performance and efficiency when handling page faults.

                        When a page needs to be replaced (because the memory is full), 
                        instead of immediately discarding the old page, it is moved into
                        a buffer pool (also called a free or secondary list). This buffer
                        stores recently evicted pages for a short time, allowing the system to
                        quickly retrieve them if they are needed again soon, avoiding expensive disk I/O.<br>

            <strong> How it works </strong>
        <br>
                <p class="mx-10">
                    1 Page Access:

                    If the page is in memory, it’s a hit.

                    If not, it’s a page fault.<br>

                    2 Page Fault Handling:

                    Check if the page is in the buffer (a recently evicted page list).

                    If it's in the buffer, it can be quickly restored to memory — this is called a soft miss.

                    If it's not in the buffer, it's a hard miss, and the page must be fetched from disk.<br>

                    3 Replacement Policy:

                    When memory is full, use a basic replacement algorithm like Second Chance, FIFO, or LRU to evict a page.

                    Instead of discarding it, place the evicted page into the buffer pool.<br>

                    4 Buffer Management:

                    The buffer has limited size.

                    It may use FIFO to manage its entries — oldest pages get removed first.<br>
